# Run Locally - Simplest Solution

Since Railway is giving issues, here's the easiest way to use the tool:

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/ad/Tool
python3 web_app.py
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

**That's it!** Everything works perfectly locally.

## 🌐 Share with Others (Optional)

If you want others to access it:

### Option 1: ngrok (Easiest)
```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok

# Run your app
python3 web_app.py

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 8000
```

You'll get a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

### Option 2: localhost.run (No Install)
```bash
# Run your app
python3 web_app.py

# In another terminal
ssh -R 80:localhost:8000 localhost.run
```

You'll get a public URL instantly!
