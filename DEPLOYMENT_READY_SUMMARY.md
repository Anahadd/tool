# ‚úÖ Your Site is Deployment Ready!

## üéâ Summary

Your **Kalshi Impressions Tool** has been optimized and is now **production-ready** for deployment to any cloud platform.

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. **Security Enhancements**
- ‚úÖ **Configurable CORS**: Added `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
  - Default: `*` (allow all) for development
  - Production: Set to your domain(s) for security
  - Example: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.railway.app`

### 2. **Production Configuration**
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Host/Port**: Reads from environment variables
  - `HOST`: Defaults to `0.0.0.0` in production, `127.0.0.1` locally
  - `PORT`: Reads from env (required by Railway, Heroku, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Logging**: Set via `LOG_LEVEL` env var
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detection**: Automatically enables dev mode locally, production mode when deployed

### 3. **Docker Optimization**
- ‚úÖ **`.dockerignore` created**: Reduces image size significantly
  - Excludes tests, dev files, documentation, git history
  - Keeps only essential files for deployment
  - Results in faster builds and smaller images

### 4. **Health Monitoring**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced `railway.json`**: Added health check configuration
  - Uses `/api/health` endpoint
  - Automatic restart on failure
  - Works with Railway's monitoring system

### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- ‚úÖ **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**: Complete guide for 9 deployment platforms
  - Railway, Render, Fly.io, Google Cloud Run, AWS, Azure, Heroku, DigitalOcean, Self-hosted
  - Step-by-step instructions for each
  - Cost comparisons and recommendations
- ‚úÖ **`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`**: Quick reference checklist
- ‚úÖ **Updated `README.md`**: Points to deployment resources
- ‚úÖ **Updated `env.example`**: Includes new security options
