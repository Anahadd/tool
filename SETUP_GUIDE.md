## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "redirect_uri_mismatch" Error

**Symptoms**: Can't complete OAuth, Google shows error 400

**Solutions**:
1. Check `BASE_URL` in Railway has **no trailing slash**
2. Check redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches exactly:
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/api/oauth-callback
   ```
3. Make sure you're using **Web application** credentials (not Desktop)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes after changing Google Cloud settings

### Issue 2: "This app isn't verified" Warning

**Symptoms**: Google shows warning during OAuth

**Solution**: This is normal for testing!
- Click **"Advanced"**
- Click **"Go to Kalshi Impressions Tool (unsafe)"**
- This only appears for test users
- To remove: Submit app for verification (not required for internal use)

### Issue 3: Upload Credentials Works, But Connect Fails

**Symptoms**: Credentials upload succeeds, but OAuth fails

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you downloaded **Web application** credentials
2. Check if you accidentally used Desktop credentials:
   - Open `credentials.json` in text editor
   - Should have `"web": {` not `"installed": {`
3. If wrong type, delete and create new **Web application** credentials

### Issue 4: "Google Sheets not connected" After OAuth

**Symptoms**: OAuth succeeds but update fails

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you completed OAuth flow in the popup
2. Hard refresh the page (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`)
3. Try uploading credentials and connecting again
4. Check Railway logs for specific errors

### Issue 5: Popup Blocked

**Symptoms**: OAuth popup doesn't open

**Solutions**:
1. Allow popups for your Railway site
2. Try clicking the button again
3. Check browser console for errors

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials**:
   - `credentials.json` should be in `.gitignore`
   - Upload it manually through the web interface

2. **Use specific CORS origins in production**:
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-actual-domain.com
   ```

3. **Limit OAuth scopes**:
   - Only request spreadsheets and drive.readonly
   - Never request more permissions than needed

4. **Keep test users list minimal**:
   - Only add people who need access
   - Remove users when they leave

5. **Rotate tokens periodically**:
   - Regenerate Apify token every 6 months
   - Create new OAuth credentials if compromised
